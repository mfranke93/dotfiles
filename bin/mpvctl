# Script to send commands to a running mpv instance.

# The instance has to be launched with the --input-ipc-server flag pointing to
# a path where a socket is then created. Writing mpv commands to that socket
# then executes those commands in the mpv instance. This script collects some
# basic functionalities, like play/pause, for the purpose of making mpv
# controllable via hotkeys in i3.
