# dotfiles

This is my collection of configuration files for my Linux systems. This is
centered around my current notebook, a Lenovo Thinkpad X230 running Arch Linux.

## Files

The `install` script softlinks all the config files to the appropriate
locations and backups the old config files in that location if they exist.
